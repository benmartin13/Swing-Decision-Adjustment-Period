# Swing-Decision-Adjustment-Period
For this task, I was asked by an organization to prepare a report investigating whether there is any recency effect of promotion that affects a player's 
swing decisions at the plate. Due to the proprietary nature of the project, I cannot publish the data set or all of the analysis, 
but this provides a snapshot of the process used to answer this question.
